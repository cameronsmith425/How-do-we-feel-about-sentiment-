### Our Story

Our group is called *Musetti ADAletti* because beside the truly love for ADA lectures we are very into pets. Two of us are from Italy, one speaks fluently italian and the other wants to learn it. What better way to combine the love for Italy and the love for adorable animals than take inspiration from the Italian Instagram page of [Musetti Animaletti](https://www.instagram.com/musetti_animaletti/?hl=en)?

Check out the instagram page of these lovely pets! You will understand why we choose these mascots.
