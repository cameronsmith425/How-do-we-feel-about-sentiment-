We are three master students and a PhD student from [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/about/) passionate about data analysis and social sciences. This webpage is the result of a group project over the time of three weeks for the course of Applied Data Analysis (ADA in short).

### Our Story

Two of us are from Italy, one speaks fluently italian and the other one wants to learn it (you should too, italian is very very cool). Our group is called *Musetti ADAletti* because beside the intense love for ADA lectures we also love pets, four-legged friends and whatever-legged animals. And what better way to combine the love for Italy and the love for adorable animals than take inspiration from the Italian Instagram page of [Musetti Animaletti](https://www.instagram.com/musetti_animaletti/?hl=en)?

Check out the instagram page of these lovely pets! You will understand why we choose these mascots.
