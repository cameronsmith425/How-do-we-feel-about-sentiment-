subtitle: The data we used to base our conclusions

The results you are seeing are based on a follow up of a paper from [Hai Liang and King-wa Fu](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0134270). These scientists had the double aim of generalizing and testing ten propositions made in previous Twitter studies and developing an adequate and replicable sampling method to study computational social sciences. We used the same tweeter user IDs and we extracted tweets text using Twitter APIs. *explain more

The tweets collected have been cleaned up and preprocessed with complex and annoying natural language toolkits, we will not annoy you with those. But don't worry, everything went well trust us.
